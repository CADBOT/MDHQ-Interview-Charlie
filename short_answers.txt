1. O(n) means that in the worst cast scenario, there will be approximately one operation for each of the n inputs.
O(n^2) means for each fo the n inputs, there will be approximately n operations. By approximently, I mean within
an order of magnitude. (For the mathematically inclined, that means we consider only the leading term and drop its
coefficient :) )
2. Pick an arbitary element in the array. This point will be called the pivot. Reorder the array so all values
less than the pivot come before it, and all values greater than it come after it. Recursively quicksort to
each of the new sub arrays.
3. A C Pointer holds the address of a place in memory.
4. Stack memory only exsists in the block it's declared. The data for the stack is reserved when a function
is called, and the stack is popped in a LIFO matter. Heap memory is dynamically allocated and deallocated.
Because of this heap memory can live beyond the block it's declared, as it isn't automatically popped off
at the end of the block
5. Garbage collectors are used to free the programmer from having to manually allocate and deallocate memory.
Garbage collectors tend to increase programmer productivity, at the expense of the programmer having less control.
